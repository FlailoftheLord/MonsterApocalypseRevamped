# MonsterApocalypseRevamped

I'll be posting experimental builds within a week, depending on how the progress goes.

You can keep up with my progress in the 'MonsterApocalypseRevamped Changelog.txt'

I will keep that up to date with my current progress on the recode!

Here's the last 1.13.2 build i'm going to be making.
https://github.com/FlailoftheLord/MonsterApocalypseRevamped/releases/tag/v1.0.10

~~All Progress has been moved to the 1.14 branch, as I'll be building this for 1.14, as it becomes more stable!

# Dependencies
  All of these are optional, and MonsterApocalypse will work without them.
  
  Note: this works for spigot v1.16.3 ONLY, unless otherwise specified
    
   WorldGuard can be used to define custom flags for regions, either denying or allowing block breaking and building.
  use the flags **monsterapocalypse-destroy** and **monsterapocalypse-build** if you have WorldGuard installed.
    
   CoreProtect is used for block logging & rollbacks, you can enable the hook in the *config.yml* file.  This allows you to rollback    blocks/areas that were modified by mobs, for example, mobs placing blocks, can be rolled back using CoreProtect.
  
   ProtocolLib is just used for some QOL features, such as block breaking animations, mob animations and such.
   If there are errors on startup, make sure you install ProtobolLib before contacting me, because it's most likely just something that needed to use it.
  
  
  - **WorldGuard**  use version 7.0.4 https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard/files/3066271
  
  - **CoreProtect**  use version 19.2 https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/download?version=355730
