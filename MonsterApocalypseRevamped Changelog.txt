Henlo, i'll be posting all the updates and changes here as i progress with the recode of the plugin!
Check back for further updates :p

Estimated Completion: 12%

(Jan-17-2019) Finished Spawnpoints Command Tutorial

(Jan-18-2019) 
- Wrapping up Spawnpoint Commands, working on FileLoader methods, saving configurations, and loading settings.

(Jan-19-2019) 
- Beginning work on auto-spawning based on the spawnpoints. Smoothed out the spawnpoint editor.

(Jan-20-2019) 
- Spawnpoints' auto-spawning finished, adding more options and args to the spawnpoint command...

(Jan-21-2019) 
- Plugin loads default values into the MobSettings.yml file...
- Added controls and toggles for Natural Spawns... (more on that later)

(Jan-22-2019)
- Starting work on Mobs' AI.
this will be the starting point for forced mob-aggro, air-bridging to players, 
climbing/building over walls and obstacles... and loads more!

(Jan-23-2019)
- Distinguishes between Hostile, Passive, and non-AI mobs.
- Adding distinctive behaviors for each type.
- made file handler save files on shutdown...
- when plugin loads, it checks if the server is running Spigot v1.13...
if not, it shuts down the plugin with an error message.

(Jan-24-2019)
- Mobs will now auto attack if you get within their range.
- added toggle for MegaAggro and variables to control how far away the mobs will get aggro'd at you.
- speed modifiers added.

(Jan-31-2019)  
- redoing the file loading methods... the settings file isn't modifiable from the server end.
- adding wall-attacking/block breaking, range for mobs.
A whitelist of mobs who are allowed to break blocks, and a list of blocks that mobs can break.

(Feb-1-2019)
- made a ton of progress on the wall attacking methods... 
- released another experimental build on GitHub.

(Feb-11-2019)
- Finished up wall attacking, it looks completely realistic now!
- Beginning work on entity target AI, the abilty for any mob to shoot a player with a custom projectile... 
And also passive mobs will be able to attack players as well... 
This is going to take a TON of work, so don't be surprised if i don't show any progress reports for the next week or so.
- Finally, i'll release a third build, which boasts the finalized wall attacking methods. :)
Again, thanks for y'alls patience, i'm struggling to keep up with a number of different projects on top of this one.
